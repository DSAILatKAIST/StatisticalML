## Challenge Objective

- The goal of this challenge is to predict actual transaction price of apartments in Seoul and Busan, Korea.
- We will provide you with apartment transaction prices for five consecutive years (e.g., 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022), and your task will be to build a machine learning (ML) model that can predict the apartment transaction price for the following year (e.g. 2023).
- You are free to try any ML methods, not limited to those we learned in our lectures.
- Beside the ML methods you choose, engineering given data will further improve ML methods’ performance. Feel free to adapt any kind of data engineering skill during competition!

## Data

**We prepare the challenge data by preprocessing a publicly available dataset from a previous competition hosted on Dacon.** [[Link]](https://dacon.io/competitions/official/21265/overview/description)

- train.csv: This file contains the training data you can use for this challenge. It contains 329,690
rows and 13 columns, which include the target column named “PRICE” representing actual
transaction price of apartments. Specifically, the training data includes the transactions of past
5-years (2018 ~ 2022).

- test.csv: This file will be used for testing your model performance. It contains 85,097 rows
and 12 columns without target column.

- park.csv: This contains additional information on the parks in Seoul and Busan. It contains
1359 parks and related information on the park.

- day_care_center.csv: This contains additional information on the daycare center in Seoul and
Busan. It contains 7373 daycare centers and related information on the daycare center.
